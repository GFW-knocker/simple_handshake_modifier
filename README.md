## simple_handshake_modifier



most of GFW protocol filtering can be bypassed by modification of handshake<br>
just set your config to <code>127.0.0.1:2500</code><br>
then modify handshake on the fly to experiment around firewall<br>

#### this tool is for research , not final product
### happy bypassing!
